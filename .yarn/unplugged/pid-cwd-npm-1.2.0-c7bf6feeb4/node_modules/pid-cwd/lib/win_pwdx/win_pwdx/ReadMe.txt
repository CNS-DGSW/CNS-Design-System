    CONSOLE APPLICATION : proc_wd Project Overview
========================================================================

win_pwdx.cpp contains 99.97% of code borrowed from Giampaolo Rodola's marvellous work on psutil.
Even if thanked him a billion times, I would feel short.

3 Day continuous struggle on getting 32 bit and 64 bit compatibility was put to a complete end by his code.

Big thanks to him one more time.
